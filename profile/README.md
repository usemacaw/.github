### Our Mission

Voice should be a first-class interface in every application — not a luxury reserved for big tech. We're building the open-source infrastructure to make that happen.

### Projects

| Project | Description | |
|---|---|---|
| **[Macaw OpenVoice](https://github.com/usemacaw/macaw-openvoice)** | Production voice runtime — STT + TTS with OpenAI-compatible API, real-time streaming, and multi-engine support | [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/usemacaw/macaw-openvoice?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/usemacaw/macaw-openvoice) |

### Get Started

```bash
# Fast and Easy
pip install macaw-openvoice[faster-whisper]
macaw pull faster-whisper-tiny
macaw serve
```

That's it. You now have a voice API running locally with OpenAI SDK compatibility.
